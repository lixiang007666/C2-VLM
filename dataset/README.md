# C2-SegDB


⚠️ There is a typographical error in our manuscript, which we correct as follows:
- We constructed C2-SegDB (Cardio-Cerebrovascular Segmentation Dataset), the first dataset to simultaneously cover cardiovascular CTA and cerebrovascular TOF-MRA scans with diverse vascular pathologies. The dataset includes 120 patients, and the vascular annotations were manually refined by trained annotators and reviewed by senior radiologists.

> **Status:** The associated paper is currently under review.
> The dataset files, annotations, and official splits will be released as part of our future work after the review process.
